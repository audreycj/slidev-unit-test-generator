# CLI Unit Test Generator: A Slidev Presentation

This repository contains a slide deck created using the Slidev presentation tool. It covers the tools used when creating my CLI Unit Test Generator, and was created for my presentation as an intern at ChatChatABC, Davao City, Philippines. Each slide has thorough presenter notes that can be viewed in the slides.md file or through presenter view.


## Getting Started

To view the presentation, simply clone this repository and open the slides.md file in any integrated development environment (IDE). Open a new terminal and type the command:

```
npm run dev
```

The slide deck should show up on a new tab at your default browser.
